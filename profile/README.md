# Tags Based Recommendation Engine (WIP)
A simple yet effective way of generating recommendations based on tags using [cosine similarity](https://github.com/Tags-Based-Recommendation-Engine/.github/blob/master/docs/cosine_similarity.md) and [clustering](https://github.com/Tags-Based-Recommendation-Engine/.github/blob/master/docs/clustering.md) implemented using django, tensorflow and sqlite3.

## Project Structure
There are 2 repositories: 
- [engine-control](https://github.com/Tags-Based-Recommendation-Engine/engine-control): A UI for triggering various script operations and also setting up automation, based on Django.
- [storefront](https://github.com/Tags-Based-Recommendation-Engine/storefront): An example webstore to showcase the functionality of the recommendation engine, based on Django.
