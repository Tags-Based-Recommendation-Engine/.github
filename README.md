There are 4 main repositories: 
- [analytics](): Frontend for providing data analytics, based on Django.
- [recommendation-control](): A UI for triggering various script operations and also setting up automation, based on Django.
- [storefront](): An example webstore to showcase the functionality of the recommendation engine, based on Django.
- [scripts](): Various scripts used for generation of recommendations, analytics etc.
